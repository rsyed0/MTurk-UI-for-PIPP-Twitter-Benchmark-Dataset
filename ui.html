                </p>

                <p> In order to annotate, first click once on a word that you think is a potential argument for the
                    described event. Then you would have to choose which event is being triggered by that word. You also
                    have the option to delete an already chosen trigger word or edit the events triggered by it
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul>Important Notes:
                    <li> There can be sentences without any events. No need to annotate anything for such sentences.
                    </li>
                    <li> A trigger word can be linked to one or more events. Choose all possible events in such cases.
                    </li>
                    <li> Multiple events can be present in a given sentence. Mark all such events. </li>
                    <li> The same event can occur multiple times (at different parts) in the same sentence. Mark all
                        occurrences of the event. </li>
                    <li> You will be able to submit the HIT at the last sentence once you finish annotating all the
                        sentences. </li>
                    <li> Select the "flag" event if you see multiple words as triggering words or any other ambiguous
                        situations, but do not abuse this function. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Here are more detailed instructions for how to choose the most appropriate triggering word: <br>
                    <br>
                    Goal: Look for the one word that MOST LIKELY manifests the event's occurrence. You can use the
                    following priority order for annotation:
                <ol>
                    <li> Most of the times, the trigger of the event will be the the <span style="color:blue"> <b>main
                                verb </b></span> in the sentence. </li>
                    <li> If the verb is ambiguous/vague, the trigger would be a <span style="color:blue"> <b> noun
                            </b></span> semantically related to event. </li>
                    <li> (Rare case) If no such noun exists, the trigger would be any <span style="color:blue"> <b>
                                adjective/adverb </b></span> that is related to the event. </li>
                    <li> If still confused, use your best judgement to select the trigger. </li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span style="color:blue"> <b>CASE I : main verb</b></span> <br>
                    Example Sentence: "I was coughing and got a fever yesterday but today just confirmed I did not get
                    COVID"<br>
                    Annotation: There are 2 events of <i>symptom</i> and 1 event of <i>infect</i> in this example as
                    follows (trigger words marked in blue): <br>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>...<span style="color:blue"><b>got</b></span> a fever... ->Event <i>symptom</i></li>
                    <li>...was <span style="color:blue"><b>coughing</b></span>... ->Event <i>symptom</i></li>
                    <li>Note 1: “fever" and "COVID" are NOT marked as triggering word of the events since the main verbs
                        indicate the event.<br>
                        Note 2: Here, due to the presence of “and”, we have two occurrences of the event <i>symptom</i>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Also "get COVID" appears, but since there is a negation confirming no infection actually took
                        place, there should be no infect event annotation.</li>
                </ol>

                    Note 2: Intuitively, getting tested for COVID helps to control the pandemic, but event "control"

                    Note 1: "mask requirement" and "social distance" are policies to control the COVID pandemic. But
                    there is no mention of COVID/virus/disease in the sentence, it’s unclear if these measures help to
                    control the pandemic. Thus, no <i>control</i> event. <br> <br>
                    Note 2: ”wear a mask" and "follow the rules" are actions to prevent COVID infection, but again since
                    nothing is explicitly specified, no <i>prevent</i> event is annotated.
