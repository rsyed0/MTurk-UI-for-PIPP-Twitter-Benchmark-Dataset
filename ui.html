            <short-summary>
                <p>An Event is defined as something happens in a sentence. Each event may has several arguments, which
                    contain more specific information we are interested in. In this task, we are trying to identify
                    whether one or more of the following events exist in a given string: <i>infect,
                        spread,symptom,prevent,control, cure, and death</i> as well as some of their arguments.
                    <br><br>
                    If an event exists, there will be a major <b>triggering word</b> that mostly manifests its
                    occurrence.
                    We then search for arguments related to this event from the sentence (which may or may not exist).
                    <br><br>
                    For each sentence, we have already marked the Event (if any) and its triggering word, as well as
                    their arguments (if any). Your task is to <b>look through these annotations</b> and check
                    "incorrect" if you disagree with them and write down your opinion.

                    <br><br>
                    Generally, do the three things for each sentence you receive:
                <ol>
                    <li>Look through each event and their arguments, if you agree with everything, move on to the next
                        question.</li>
                    <li>If you think any annotations are incorrect, clicked the ""incorrect"" box and write down your
                        opinion in the box below.</li>
                    <li>If you think current event should not exist or other events should exist in this sentence,
                        clicked the ""incorrect"" box and write down your opinion in the box below.</li>
                </ol>
                <br><br>
                While using your best knowledge to judge does each event and each argument make sense, here are some
                rules specific to this task:
                <ol>

                    <li>If there is explicit negation of an event, that event should not exist. <br>
                        Example: In ""This vaccine cannot cure the illness"", event cure does not exist.</li>
                    <li>Arguments are not required to be rigorous or specific. <br>
